User Story: Dice Generator

As a user, I want to be able to choose different dice with different number of faces 
(D6 or D9) by selecting from a dropdown list.

1. User lands on the website.
2. User selects a dice from the dropdown list (D6 or D9).
3. User clicks on the "Roll" button.
4. After 3 seconds, it will show a random face of the dice that user has selected.
